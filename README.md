# stock_analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to provide a tool that Steve could use to analyze stock returns. We began with a VBA script that analyzed specific years 2017 and 2018, then later we refactored the code so we can run the analysis on datasets from any given year. We also included a timer feature in the script that gives the time it takes to run the code. The purposed of refactoring was to make the script run faster and we compared our run time results from the previous script and the refactored one. 


## Results: 

Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.


## Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.

* What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

* How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
